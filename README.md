## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javscript

### What I learned

Great opportunity to continue to work with the Dom in Javascript.  I explored the use of the invalid CSS psuedo selector, the placholder attribute as well as re-positioning items on the page with the exclamation point being re-positioned into the input.  

Great intro project.

### Continued development

I will definitly continue to work with forms.  This gave me a taste of how much I still have to learn.  Looking forward to the next project!
